# Approach of a ExpoRoute-Redux-based Authentication (Easy Way)

While the Expo documentation (v1) provides guidance on securing routes using `useContext`, this approach is not directly applicable when working with Redux in the latest manner. The code in this repository demonstrates an alternative approach using Redux instead of the React `useContext` hook.

**Included Dependencies:**

- `react-redux`
- `@reduxjs/toolkit`
